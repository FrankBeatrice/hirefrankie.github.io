I'm **Kiko Beats**, programmer and software engineer. At the moment I'm writing this, I'm **23.67** years old â€” that's 8639.55 days to be precise!

I'm a graduate in Computer Science and Software Engineering of the University of Murcia, specialized in Information Technology.

Although I want to have an academic profile (one of my life's objetives is to join in the MIT PhD program), I need to put in practice what I learn to consolidate knowledge.

I'm currently working at [SocialBro](http://www.socialbro.com) â€“ a platform to optimize Twitter marketing strategies, discovering, segmenting and executing actions based in audiences â€“ with an awesome team of talented people. 

Behind the scenes, we use JavaScript to connect many services, such as [IBM Watson supercomputer](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson), different databases and all the things you can imagine related with *Big Data*.

I enjoy experimenting with code. Some of the code I feel more proud of are those small pieces of code that I can combine in any project in order to build something bigger and deeper, for example:

* [Bumped](https://github.com/bumped/bumped#bumped) â€“ Makes easy release software. Pre and Post hooks for the deploy process.
* [Fetch Timeline](https://github.com/Kikobeats/fetch-timeline-cli#fetch-timeline-cli) â€“ Fetching Twitter user's timeline from your terminal.
* [Acho](https://github.com/Kikobeats/acho#acho) â€“ An extremely simple (but powerful) logging system for NodeJS and browser.
* [Finepack](https://github.com/Kikobeats/finepack#finepack) â€“ Organizes and maintains readable your JSON files.
* [JSON Future](https://github.com/Kikobeats/json-future#json-future) â€“ Modern JSON interface as proposition for ECMAScript 7.

...and more in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kikobeats?tab=repositories).

Don't read bad: I love using JavaScript because it's easy, small, plug-and-play, and it gives you early feedback. However, the programming language is just the tool. The programmer is the problem solver, the one who has to use the proper tools.

I believe in the importance of **Open Source**. In a world where software is increasingly decisive, the only way to improve your code (and yourself) is by sharing knowledge. I've contributed in projects like [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails), [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) or [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost).

Another important point associated with Open Source is the culture generated around the projects, and people who make it possible. Culture and people are the two factors I want to have in my everyday work.

Culture and people team are the two factor that I want to have in my job.

However, it's not all about code. I need to be active. Believe it or not, sport makes me a better programmer! I'm specially in love with windsurfing, but I also like running mid/long distances and carving the city on my longboard.
