Yesterday I wanted to create a new Github repository, but the name of the repository seemed long. But hey, what is long?

A little experiment to view how Github manage the length of a proyect name, URL, resume, and file.

Yeap, I pasted a txt of the Bible.

Only the length of the name is limited to 100 characters. Other fields look like infinite. Of course, the UX is broken.
