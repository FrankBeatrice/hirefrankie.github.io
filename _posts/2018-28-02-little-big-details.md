## Color

-  Use **color** and **weight** to create hierarchy instead of size.

- Never use [black](https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black). Combine a palette based on a color, from *lightest* to *darkest*. I like generate palette colors using [palx](https://palx.jxnblk.com).

- Donâ€™t use grey text on colored backgrounds. **Satinate** or **opacity** are better options. [Monochrome](https://monochrome.jxnblk.com) is a good tool for do that.

- Use **accent colors** (for example, at the border) to add color to a bland design.

## Interaction

- Transitions should be clear, simple, and coherent. **Quick**. They should avoid doing too much at once.

- On mobile, a transition occur over **300ms**. On desktop the value should be around **200ms**.

- Transitions that exceed **400ms** may feel too slow.


## Typography

- Choose your typography based on **legibility** and **context**.

- Two font families are enough for distinguish between **heading** and **body**. A common pattern is use **Sans Serif** and **Sans** respectively.

- Two font weights is usually enough: A **normal** font weight (400 or 500) and **bold** (600 or 700) for text you want to emphasize.

- Font weights under 400 are **hard** to read.

## Shadow

[](https://material.io){:.card-preview}

- Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, use subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as distracting.

- Use balance shadows, this means, it looks more natural. [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html) has grateful [guidelines](https://codepen.io/sdthornton/pen/wBZdXq#code-area).
