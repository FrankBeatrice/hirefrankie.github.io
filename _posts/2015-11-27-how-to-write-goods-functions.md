> Every function or piece of code should have one entry point (input) and one exit point (output). â€“ Edsger W. Dijkstra.

## About the implementation.

- Do one thing. Be Small.
- One level of abstraction per function.
- One level of indentation per function.

## About the interface.

- One or two arguments is nice, never more than three.
- Never flags arguments.

## About the workflow.

- Sort function from high level to low level.
- Warning with wreck train (don't talk to strangers).
