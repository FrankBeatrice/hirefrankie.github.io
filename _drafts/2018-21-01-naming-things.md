Because naming is hard, when you create a new project is important choose the right name.

Based on my experience, a *good name* for a project should be check the major part of the list:

- [ ] Short and easy to pronounce in English.
- [ ] Evident is better than clever. Also better for SEO.
- [ ] Naming should be evokes an action with the product.
- [ ] Keep in mind alphabetical position can be an advantage.
- [ ] Think in the copy and synonymous words.
